My Repo holds the code to a 2d platform game, that involves collision detection, and keyboard event listeners without the use of canvas! In the game you play as a purple square looking to escape a dangerous reality and get back home!

# My Game

My Game is a 2d platform game that requires you to jump over obstacles and to reach the portal to get back home!
  ## What is a Platforming Game?
  A platformer is a video game in which the game-play revolves heavily around players controlling a character who runs and jumps onto platforms, floors, ledges, stairs or other objects depicted on a single or scrolling (horizontal or vertical) game screen.
